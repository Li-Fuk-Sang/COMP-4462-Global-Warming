            <p>
                Over the years, global warming had become one of the most talked about issues around our planet. While
                there are still many disagreements surrounding the severity of warming, empirical evidence has shown
                that our planet is unarguably warming up when compared to before the industrial revolution. The rise in
                temperature is hypothesized to lead to irreversible consequences, such as a rise in sea level or extreme
                weather.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>What role is Hong Kong playing in terms of global warming?</i>
                <i>How is Hong Kong being affected?</i>
                <i>What have we done to combat our emissions throughout the years?</i>
                These are essential questions we would need to answer
                in deciding policies surrounding climate change. This dashboard attempts to answers these questions in a
                storyline format.

            <H1>Cause and Effect</H1>
            <p>
                An important question to ask when analysing global warming dataset is: <i>whether countries that emits
                    the most suffers the most severe consequences?</i> Short answer: Not necessarily.
            </p>
            <p>
                The graph to the left plots a country’s CO2 emission against the country’s temperature rise since 1990s.
                Each country is marked by a bubble, while the size of the bubble encodes the population of the country.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is easy to see that there are no clear relationships between how much a country emits and how much
                its temperature increase. <strong>In order words, a country might suffer severely from temperature rise
                    even
                    though it is not responsible for making any emissions.</strong> This observation leads to some
                interesting
                questions. For example, how can we incentivize big countries to make less emissions, while they are
                often not that ones to be affect by it?
            </p>
            <h2>Surprising correlation between mean temperature and temperature rise</h2>
            <p>
                Another interesting observation came from the fact that blue dots are generally higher than the orange
                dots. This implies that colder countries tend to suffer a higher degree of temperature rise when
                compared to hotter ones. This finding was not hypothesized in the initial proposal and was a surprise to
                our team.

            <p>
                If we <strong>change the encoding</strong>, we can easily see where Hong Kong is when compared to
                countries of similar population, which will be important for the discussion to come.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is not difficult to see that Hong Kong sits comfortably in the middle, both in terms of temperature
                rise and carbon emission.
            </p>
            <p>
                A concerning observation came from the fact that despite of Hong Kong’s relatively small population, it
                emits carbon levels similar to some much bigger countries. In the 2013 snapshot, it can easily be seen
                that Hong Kong emits comparable CO2 when compared to the Nigeria or Bangladesh.

            <p>
                The annual OVERALL Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission in Hong Kong has been on a steady incline since the
                millennium. With the growth in population and economy, this should be no surprise. Little did the public
                know, the government had been secretly plotting for an impact. When the figures for 2020 GHG emissions
                were released, the tides turned. The reduction of emissions by 25% in 2020 compared to the recent peak
                in 2014 shocked many, and the secret decarbonisation strategy was a success.
            </p>
            <p>
                The GHG in Hong Kong can be categorised into six major sectors, “Electricity Generation and Other Energy
                Industries”, “Transport”, “Waste”, “Industrial Processes and Product Use”, “Agriculture, Forestry and
                Other Land Use” and “Other End Use of Fuel”. For the last 30 years, the GHG emissions of the first 4
                categories have been on an increasing trend, while the remaining 2 declined. Energy generation has
                always been the largest GHG emitter in Hong Kong, contributing to around two-thirds of the overall
                emission.

            Hong Kong started to
            improve its electricity generation policy
            since 2014, gradually replacing coal with natural
            gas,
            which is a <span style="color: green">cleaner fuel</span>. As the two power companies obtained new gas-fired
            generating units in 2020, the
            share
            of
            natural gas in the fuel mix surged along with the decline in coal. This explains the <span
                style="color: rgb(221, 144, 3)">dramatic drop</span> in GHG
            emissions by
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Electricity Generation</span> in 2020, and the <span
                style="color: rgb(221, 144, 3)">all-time low</span> in overall GHG emissions in 19 years.<br><br>
            Another category that has been emitting less GHG in recent years is <span
                style="font-weight: bold">Transport</span>. Hong Kong has been actively
            promoting
            transport electrification, waiving the first registration tax for electric commercial vehicles in full and
            subsidising
            trials of over 170 electric goods vehicles under the New Energy Transport Fund. This has resulted in <span
                style="color: green">fewer

                pollution</span>.<br><br>

            These policies have proved effective and contributed to the <span
                style="color: rgb(221, 144, 3)">significant reduction</span> in GHG emissions in 2020. The
            government’s long-term commitment to decarbonisation has paid off and Hong Kong is well on its way to a

            <p>
                As shown in the industrial sectors section, Hong Kong's GHG emission has been on a steady incline.
                GHG emission is known to trap heat which means that Hong Kong's temperature might be on a rise. To
                visualize this,
                a symbol map with radial heatmap pop up is made.

                A symbol map consisting of line charts is made to show the yearly average temperature of each weather
                station.
                By observing the line charts, we can see that Hong Kong's temperature is on a steady increase,
                confirming
                the information displayed in the top most visualization. This is also proof that Hong Kong is facing
                climate change
                and should execute proper policy to prevent the rising any further.

            <H1>Radial Heatmap</H1>
            <p>
                A comparison should be made at each station to see the impact of climate change on Hong Kong's
                temperature. This way, the only independent variable is the station's location, and the dependent
                variable
                is the temperature change. Since Hong Kong has four seasons, it will only be fair to compare the
                temperature
                for each month. Because of this, a radial heatmap is the most suitable data visualization for this task.
            </p>
            <p>
                By clicking on the line chart, you can find the radial heatmap. The radial heatmap has 12 parts which
                denote the months of the year. Using a radial heatmap, you can go along the parts and compare
                temperature
                change fairly. An exciting finding observed is that utilizing a radial heatmap shows a relatively
                increasing
                temperature in all other months on all weather stations. This supports the claims made in the first
                visualization of Hong Kong’s increasing temperature.

                Effect of climate change on Hong Kong's air quality and beach waters
            </h1>
            <p>
                While temperature is a well known factor that is correlated with climate change, there are some other
                effects that are less known.
                With greater GHG emissions, air quality in the city is also affected with data showing an increasing
                amounts of pollutants, such as NO2, O3, and CO2.
                Meanwhile, with climate change bringing about more frequent storms to the city, flooding and strong
                rains have caused overflow of sewages to waters of Hong Kong, thus endangering the water quality of
                water recreational areas such as beachs.
                Given this, our team has visualized the trend of Hong Kong's air quality index and beach water quality
                in two visualizations to have a better understanding of how these factors have been affected.

            <h1>Air Quality Index</h1>
            <p>
                A symbol map consisting of line charts is made to show the yearly average air quality index of each weather
                station.
                By observing the line charts, we can see that Hong Kong's air quality shows a similar trend in all weather stations. 
                While some line charts indicate worse air quality at certain regions, the overall slowly improving trend is 
                definetly an unexpected finding. With the impact of climate change being felt greater around the world, it is surprising to see
                a unique trend against expectations. This is proof that Hong Kong is acting on the climate change issue
                and is executing proper policy to further improve the city's air quality.

            <h1>Beach Water Quality</h1>
            <p>
                A symbol map consisting of markers is made to show the yearly average beach water quality of each beach
                station in Hong Kong. The interactive visualization allows the user to click on a marker to display the beach name and 
                a line chart of its water quality over time. By observing the line charts, we can see that Hong Kong's beach water quality
                gradually worsens over time. While there are some cases which indicate beach cleaning or other external factors have returned the beach
                to low pollution levels, most beaches show significant improvements in quality overtime.
                This showcases another proof that Hong Kong is acting on the climate change issue
                and is executing proper policy to also improve the city's beach water quality.
